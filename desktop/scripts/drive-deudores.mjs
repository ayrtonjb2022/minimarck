/**
 * Run the FIRSTHAND DEBTOR DRIVE: the real app, driven through the real screens, printing what the
 * shop file then says. Companion to `drive-payment.mjs`, which proves the cash-in path; this one
 * proves the collect-the-debt path — create a customer, bill a credit sale to them, take a part
 * payment, and read the drawer, the journal and the balance back out of the real SQLite file.
 *
 * It runs against a THROWAWAY data directory so it can never touch a real shop's database:
 * MINIMARCK_DATA_DIR points the app at a temp folder, which bootstrapDatabase honours.
 *
 * Exit code is the drive's: 0 only if every check passed. `npm run drive:deudores` is a real gate.
